Implementation of variational Autoencoder in music generation

Inspired by the Variational Autoencoder developed by Google Music VAE ive developed similar architecture using keras.

the paths are related to colab's directory.

ive gathered data from different wesites. ive collected 128 classical songs from various musician like bach, beethoven, chopin etc.
ive collected their masterpieces in midi format.

i extracted notes and time interval between notes from the data my  end goal was to generate new music sequence from the input.

I added an example generated by the model.

I also added the dataset i used to train the model.
